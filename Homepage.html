            <div><h3>Hi There!</h3></div>
            <div><p>As a sophomore at St. Joseph's College of Engineering,
                I am fervently pursuing a dual degree in Electrical and Communication Engineering (ECE) alongside a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at IITM. 
                My academic journey has furnished me with a robust understanding of advanced machine learning structures and algorithms,
                augmented by a comprehensive Python course on edX.

                Beyond academia, I am actively refining my skills as a junior front-end web developer, 
                deeply engaged in a dynamic project that serves as a platform for continual growth and portfolio expansion.
                This hands-on experience allows me to craft seamless and visually captivating web solutions, showcasing my proficiency in web development.
                
                My unwavering dedication to acquiring new skills and driving tangible impact in the dynamic realm of technology propels my enthusiasm.
                I am keen to connect with fellow professionals who share my passion, 
                eager to explore collaborative ventures and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
